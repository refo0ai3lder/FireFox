# FireFox Version Archive

Welcome to ReloadFireFox, an archive of Firefox versions from the earliest days to today.

## Goal
Preserve every major and minor version of Mozilla Firefox, including betas, ESRs, and historical builds.

## Progress
- ✅ Early versions (1.x, 2.x, 3.x)
- ✅ Adding New/mid FireFox Versions Later

## Why?
For digital preservation, historical interest, testing on old systems...

## Note
All files are the original untouched installers from Mozilla's public release servers (`ftp.mozilla.org`).
